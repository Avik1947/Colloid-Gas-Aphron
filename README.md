# 🧪 Preparation of Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) Solution to Enhance CGA Stability

## 🚀 Objective
To design and optimize a CMC-based solution that improves the stability of Colloid Gas Aphron (CGA) — a colloid of soap bubble prone to instability. 

## 👨‍🔬 Why It Matters
Colloid Gas Aphron(CGA) is a potent reservoir for gases like Hydrogen, but it's chemically shy — it breaks down quickly. By introducing CMC as a stabilizing agent, we engineer a shield that preserves CGA’s integrity. 

## 🛠️ What We Did
- Prepared aqueous CMC solutions of varying concentrations.
- Mixed CMC with CGA under controlled conditions.
- experimented with different mixing techniques.
- Tracked stability over time.
- Evaluated optimal CMC concentration for maximum CGA retention.

## 📊 Key Takeaways
- CMC increases viscosity → slows degradation.
- Optimal concentration identified for peak stability.
- Method scalable and reproducible.
